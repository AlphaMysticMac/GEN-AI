       "\"Page: Manchester City F.C.\\nSummary: Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name. Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup.\\nThe club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03.\\nManchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008. This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble. This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 and 2023–24, as well as the club's first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win the Champions League and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so. The club was ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings in 2023.\\nManchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €731 million. In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion. Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Manchester City W.F.C.\\nSummary: Manchester City Women's Football Club (formerly Manchester City Ladies F.C.) is an English women's football club based in Manchester who play in the Women's Super League. It is affiliated with Manchester City which plays in the Premier League.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: 2022–23 Manchester City F.C. season\\nSummary: The 2022–23 season was the 128th season in the existence of Manchester City Football Club and their 21st consecutive season in the top flight of English football, where they were competing as two-time defending champions. In addition to the Premier League, Manchester City also participated in this season's editions of the FA Cup, EFL Cup, Community Shield and UEFA Champions League, entering the latter for the 12th consecutive season. The season was unusual in that the fixture dates of domestic and European competitions were altered to accommodate the FIFA World Cup played in November and December 2022 in Qatar.\\nManchester City kicked off the season by losing the Community Shield to Liverpool 1–3 and were knocked out of the EFL Cup by Southampton at the quarter-final stage in January 2023. On 20 May, City mathematically clinched their third consecutive Premier League title following an exciting title race with closest rivals Arsenal, who had been leading the standings for the large part of the season. On 3 June, City defeated rivals Manchester United 2–1 in the FA Cup final to win their second trophy of the season. Furthermore, the Blues had advanced to their second Champions League final in three years, where they defeated Inter Milan on 10 June in Istanbul to clinch the club's first-ever European Cup, their first European trophy since 1970, and complete only the second continental treble by an English men's team, after Manchester United in 1998–99, but the first time ever by a defending Premier League Champion. Manchester City ended the season topping the UEFA coefficient rankings.\\nOne of this season's individual highlights were the goalscoring feats of City's new striker Erling Haaland in his debut season in English football. He broke several club, league, and European records after scoring 52 goals in his first 53 games at City, going on to win multiple individual awards, including the European Golden Shoe.\\nThis was the first season since 2012–13 without former team captain Fernandinho, who left at the end of the previous season to return to Brazil, the first since 2015–16 without Gabriel Jesus, who departed to Arsenal, and the first since 2014–15 not to feature English forward Raheem Sterling, who moved to Chelsea in the summer of 2022.\""

       "'Page: LangChain\\nSummary: LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain\\'s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\\n\\nPage: Milvus (vector database)\\nSummary: Milvus is a distributed vector database developed by Zilliz. It is available as both open-source software and a cloud service.\\nMilvus is an open-source project under LF AI & Data Foundation distributed under the Apache License 2.0.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Intelligent agent\\nSummary: In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent is an entity that perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously to achieve goals, and may improve its performance through machine learning or by acquiring knowledge. Leading AI textbooks define artificial intelligence as the \"study and design of intelligent agents,\" emphasizing that goal-directed behavior is central to intelligence.\\nA specialized subset of intelligent agents, agentic AI (also known as an AI agent or simply agent), expands this concept by proactively pursuing goals, making decisions, and taking actions over extended periods, thereby exemplifying a novel form of digital agency.\\nIntelligent agents can range from simple to highly complex. A basic thermostat or control system is considered an intelligent agent, as is a human being, or any other system that meets the same criteria—such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\\nIntelligent agents operate based on an objective function, which encapsulates their goals. They are designed to create and execute plans that maximize the expected value of this function upon completion. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a reward function, which allows programmers to shape its desired behavior. Similarly, an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is guided by a fitness function.\\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as abstract functional systems similar to computer programs. To distinguish theoretical models from real-world implementations, abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents—autonomous computer programs that carry out tasks on behalf of users. They are also referred to using a term borrowed from economics: a \"rational agent\".'"
