Great question! In LangChain, Runnables are a core abstraction that help you build and orchestrate modular, composable AI pipelines. They allow components like models, chains, prompts, tools, and functions to be treated as callable units that can be executed synchronously or asynchronously.

🔁 What is a Runnable in LangChain?
A Runnable is an object that supports a .invoke() method (for running it), and can be chained, mapped, batched, streamed, or composed with other Runnables.

Think of Runnable as:

A standard interface for "things you can run" in a LangChain pipeline — such as prompts, models, retrievers, tools, and chains.

🔧 Key Types of Runnables
LangChain provides several Runnable classes to structure workflows:

Type	Purpose
RunnableMap	Applies multiple runnables to an input dictionary (like mapping fields).
RunnableLambda	Wraps a Python function as a runnable.
RunnableSequence	Chains multiple runnables in sequence — like a pipeline.
RunnableParallel	Runs multiple runnables in parallel and returns a dictionary of results.
RunnablePassthrough	Just returns the input as-is (used in branching logic).
RunnableBranch	Like if/else logic — runs a different Runnable based on a condition.
RunnableRetry	Automatically retries a Runnable on failure.
RunnableWithFallbacks	Uses fallback Runnables in case the first one fails.
🔗 Common Use Cases
Prompt + Model Pipeline

python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableSequence
chain = prompt | model | parser  # All are Runnables
result = chain.invoke({"question": "What is LangChain?"})
Custom Logic with Lambda

python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda
custom_step = RunnableLambda(lambda x: x.upper())
Branching

python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch

branch = RunnableBranch(
    (lambda x: "urgent" in x["text"], urgent_chain),
    (lambda x: "low" in x["text"], low_priority_chain),
    default_chain
)
⚡️ Features of Runnables
.invoke() – single input

.batch() – multiple inputs

.stream() – for streaming tokens (e.g., LLM output)

.transform() – generator-style processing

.with_retry() – built-in retry mechanism

.with_fallbacks() – add backup strategies
